## iOS Debug Bridge"
# An emulation of a handful of useful adb commands I use for Android devices,
# adapted for jailbroken iOS devices connected via USB.
# Supports only one iDevice plugged in at a time as of now.
#
### Usage:
# idb push [target] [destination]
#     Copies a targeted file on the computer to a destination on the iDevice.
# idb pull [target] [destination]
#     Copies a targeted file from the iDevice to a destination on the computer.
# idb shell
#     Starts a remote shell on the iDevice.
# idb shell [command]
#     Starts a remote shell on the iDevice, runs the given command, and exits.
# idb install [target]
#     Installs the indicated target IPA on the iDevice using `ipainstaller`.
#     Will need modification to work with other CLI IPA installer programs
#     (which need to be installed on the iDevice itself via Cydia or similar).
# idb devices
#     Lists the UDID's of all connected devices. Part of preliminary
#     (incomplete but planned) support for multi-device capability.
# idb list
#     Synonym for `idb devices`.
# idb kill-server
#     Kills all instances of 'iproxy,' the TCP-over-usbmuxd forwarding program.
# idb help
#     Show this usage information.
# idb -h
#     Synonym for `idb help`.
# idb --help
#     Synonym for `idb help`.
#
### System Requirements:
#### On the computer:
#     usbmuxd (https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd.git) needs to be
# running for this to work. Tested on Debian Linux, but probably works in
# Mac OS (or Windows with MSYS/Cygwin), based on past experience. On those
# platforms, installing iTunes from Apple will get you usbmuxd, but you'll
# still need to compile the "iproxy" tool from the open-source clone of
# libusbmuxd (see below).
#
#     "iproxy", found at https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd.git
# Put the binary in a directory in your $PATH variable. I use "iproxy-quiet",
# which is a custom version of it I made that doesn't print information except
# on certain errors (i.e. it follows the unix philosophy better). You will have
# to edit this file to use regular iproxy.
#
#     Included in this repository is a patch which should allow you to build
# your own "iproxy-quiet". Apply the patch with either
# `git apply iproxy-quiet.patch` or `patch -p1 < iproxy-quiet.patch` from the
# libusbmuxd source root.
#
#     For *incomplete* (currently inoperable) multi-device support,
# libimobiledevice's "tools" are also required (specifically, "idevice_id").
# These tools are in the 'tools' directory of
# https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice.git .
#
#### On the iDevice:
#     The device has to be connected via USB and have sshd listening on the port
# defined above as REMOTEPORT. Due to the sshd requirement, the device must be
# jailbroken. In Cydia, sshd is installed through the package "OpenSSH" (called
# "openssh", note the casing, if you install it via apt on the command-line).
#
#     Note also that you can get openssh either from Saurik's repository
# (available by default on basically any jailbroken iDevice), or from other
# sources like ios-webstack (see http://ios-webstack.tk ). ios-webstack has
# a newer version of OpenSSH than Saurik's repository does as of January 2018.
#
#     This script can probably be easily adapted for wireless transfers by
# commenting out the iproxy stuff and changing the IP address/LOCALPORT to
# the device address and the port that it's sshd is listening on.
#
#     To avoid having to type a password every time, set up key authentication
# between the computer and the iDevice. I DO NOT RECCOMEND disabling password
# login once key authentication is established.
#
# On the computer, run:
#   ssh-keygen
#   (leave default filenames for the keys)
#   ssh-keygen -p
#   (leave default filenames for the keys)
#
# On the iDevice (probably over ssh), run:
#   mkdir /var/mobile/.ssh
#   echo authstr >> /var/mobile/.ssh/authorized_keys
#   #(where authstr is the output of `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on the computer)
#
# Alternatively if you want to log in as root, you'd change the "DEVICE_USER" field
# above in this script and write to /var/root/.ssh/authorized_keys instead.
